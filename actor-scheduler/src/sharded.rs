//! Sharded SPSC inbox — multiple producers, each with a dedicated SPSC channel.
//!
//! Instead of N producers contending on one MPSC channel, each producer gets
//! its own SPSC ring buffer to the consumer. The consumer drains all shards
//! with round-robin fairness to prevent any single producer from starving others.
//!
//! # Shuffle-shard analogy
//!
//! Like shuffle sharding in the k8s API server, each producer is isolated:
//! a noisy producer can fill its own shard but cannot affect other producers'
//! ability to deliver messages. The topology is fixed at initialization time.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. InboxBuilder::new(capacity)       — create builder
//! 2. builder.add_producer()            — returns SpscSender, can call N times
//! 3. builder.build()                   — seals the registry, returns ShardedInbox
//! 4. inbox.drain(limit, handler)       — consumer polls all shards
//! ```
//!
//! No producers can be added after `build()`. This is the "register at init"
//! constraint — you must know all producers before the scheduler starts.
