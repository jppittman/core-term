//! Pod lifecycle types: phase state machine and restart policy.

//! These types correspond to the Kubernetes mental model:
//! - [`PodPhase`] tracks why a scheduler exited (the observable lifecycle state)
//! - [`RestartPolicy`] declares what the supervisor should do on each exit phase

/// The observable phase of a pod (actor thread) at exit.
///
/// Returned by [`ActorScheduler::run`] so a supervisor can decide whether
/// to restart the pod and with what urgency.
///
/// # Phase transitions
///
/// ```text
/// (spawned) ──► Running ──► Terminating ──► Completed   (normal exit)
///                      └──────────────────► Failed(msg) (handler error)
