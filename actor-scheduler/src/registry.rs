//! Pod slot: the reconnect primitive shared between a `ServiceHandle` and the Kubelet.
//!
//! Each `ServiceHandle<D,C,M>` owns an `Arc<PodSlot<D,C,M>>`. The Kubelet holds the
//! other `Arc` for every slot it manages. When a pod restarts, the Kubelet:
//!
//! 1. Calls `slot.publish(new_handle)` for each registered slot.
//! 2. Any `ServiceHandle` blocked in `reconnect()` wakes and takes its fresh handle.
//!
//! # One slot per ServiceHandle
//!
//! `ActorHandle` is intentionally non-`Clone` — it owns a dedicated SPSC endpoint.
//! Each `ServiceHandle` therefore has its own slot, exactly as each TCP client has
//! its own socket to the server.
