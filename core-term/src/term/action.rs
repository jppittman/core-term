// src/term/action.rs

//! Actions and events for the terminal emulator module.
//!
//! The terminal emulator processes three types of events:
//!
//! 1. **UserInputAction**: Input from the user (keyboard, mouse, clipboard)
//! 2. **ControlEvent**: Control signals from the system (resize, PTY ready, etc.)
//! 3. **EmulatorAction**: Output that the emulator signals to the application
//!
//! # Event Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! User Input / OS Events
//!       ↓
//! [UserInputAction] or [ControlEvent]
//!       ↓
//! TerminalEmulator::process()
//!       ↓
//! [EmulatorAction] (output)
//!       ↓
//! Orchestrator (execute: write PTY, render, set title, etc.)
//! ```
//!
//! # Contract Model
//!
//! Each action type establishes a contract:
//! - **Precondition**: What state must be true before sending
//! - **Action**: What the emulator does with the action
//! - **Postcondition**: What state changes result
//! - **Invariants**: Constraints that must always hold

// --- User Input Actions ---

/// Represents user-initiated actions that serve as input to the terminal emulator.
///
/// These are high-level semantic actions derived from raw OS events:
/// - Raw input (keyboard, mouse) is translated to UserInputAction
/// - The emulator processes these and produces EmulatorAction(s)
/// - The orchestrator executes the resulting actions
///
/// # Contract
///
/// **Precondition**: User performed an action (key press, mouse click, etc.)
///
/// **Emulator**: Interprets the action in the context of terminal state
/// - Updates cursor, selection, scroll position
/// - Generates write-to-PTY actions for user input
/// - May queue render requests for visual feedback
///
/// **Postcondition**: Terminal state is updated; EmulatorAction(s) are produced
///
/// This corresponds to `EmulatorInput::User(UserInputAction)`.

/// # Contract
///
/// **Sender**: Orchestrator (after receiving OS events or VSync ticks)
///
/// **Emulator**: Processes the control event and may queue EmulatorAction(s)
/// - Updates internal state (grid size, layout, etc.)
/// - Queues rendering work if needed
///
/// **Postcondition**: Emulator state is updated; orchestrator may need to render
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ControlEvent {

    /// **Emulator**:
    /// - Generates a snapshot of the current terminal state (grid, styles, cursor)

    ///

    /// - Signals that the emulator is ready to process PTY data
    /// - Allows batching of PTY reads for efficiency
    ///
    /// **Postcondition**: Orchestrator will read and process PTY data
    ///
    /// # Design Notes
    ///
    /// This is a **low-priority signal** used for flow control. The PTY I/O thread
    /// signals when data is available, and the main orchestrator thread processes
    /// it asynchronously. This prevents the PTY from blocking the UI.
    ///
    /// Follows a "doorbell" pattern:
    /// - PTY thread enqueues data and signals `PtyDataReady`
    /// - Orchestrator reads the enqueued data when convenient
    /// - Prevents busy-waiting or blocking the main event loop
    PtyDataReady,
}

// --- Emulator Actions (Signaled to Orchestrator) ---

/// Actions that the terminal emulator signals to the orchestrator.
///
/// After processing user input or control events, the emulator generates
/// a sequence of `EmulatorAction`(s) that the orchestrator must execute.
/// These actions represent changes to the outside world (PTY, window, clipboard, etc.)
///
/// # Execution Model
///
/// The orchestrator **must execute actions in order** to maintain causal consistency:
///
/// ```text
/// UserInputAction / ControlEvent
///       ↓
/// TerminalEmulator::process()
///       ↓
/// [EmulatorAction, EmulatorAction, ...]
///       ↓
/// Orchestrator executes each action in sequence
/// ```
///
/// # Contract
///
/// **Emulator** sends actions as a side effect of processing input.
///
/// **Orchestrator** must:
/// 1. Execute each action in the order sent
/// 2. Handle asynchronous operations (e.g., RequestClipboardContent may take time)
/// 3. Report results back to the emulator (e.g., pasted text via UserInputAction::PasteText)
///
/// **Postcondition**: The outside world is updated; emulator awaits next input
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum EmulatorAction {
    /// Write bytes to the pseudo-terminal.
    ///
    /// # Contract
    ///
    /// **Emulator**: Generates this action when user input should be sent to the shell.
    ///
    /// **Orchestrator**:
    /// 1. Writes the bytes to the PTY
    /// 2. May batch multiple writes for efficiency
    /// 3. Handles PTY-full (backpressure) gracefully
    ///
    /// **Postcondition**: Shell receives the input
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// - User pressed 'a' → `WritePty(b"a")`
    /// - User pressed arrow-up → `WritePty(b"\x1b[A")` (ANSI sequence)
    /// - User pasted "hello\nworld" → `WritePty(b"hello\nworld")`

    /// 1. Updates the window title bar
    /// 2. May be no-op if the window doesn't support titles
    ///
    /// **Postcondition**: Window title is updated
    ///

    ///
    /// - Shell sends: `\x1b]0;My Project\x07` (OSC 0)

    /// 1. Plays a system beep or bell sound
    /// 2. May show a visual indicator (flash, notification)
    /// 3. May be silent/no-op if disabled by user preferences
    ///
    /// **Postcondition**: Alert is signaled to the user
