//! Cold-start supervised training of the **bilinear** saturation Guide, on
//! the same strict-v1 labels and the same recipe `train_guide` used for the
//! additive one (`docs/plans/2026-09-02-bilinear-guide-registration.md` §9).
//!
//! # The whole point: one difference, and it is the functional form
//!
//! This binary exists so the comparison in the registration is
//! functional-form-vs-functional-form. Everything it can hold equal with
//! `train_guide`, it holds equal:
//!
//! | held equal | how |
//! |---|---|
//! | label source | the same `strict_labels_train.jsonl` / `_dev.jsonl` |
//! | candidate features | the same five context quantities off the same `CandidateSummary` — the neighborhood op multiset (pooled here, counted there) plus `budget_fraction`, `log1p(match_class_node_count)`, `log1p(neighborhood_op_count)`, `log1p(expr_node_count)` |
//! | dedup filtering | `dedup_repeat` rows excluded, reported, never silent |
//! | class weighting | `pos_weight = negatives / positives` measured on the TRAIN split actually used |
//! | loss | weighted BCE-with-logits, the same stable form |
//! | cold start | no warm start from any prior checkpoint |
//! | TRAIN-only | DEV never touches a gradient, never selects a hyperparameter |
//!
//! Two things could **not** be held equal, and both are recorded here and in
//! the results document rather than buried:
//!
//! 1. **Gradient clipping is on the step, not on `dLoss/dz`.** `train_guide`
//!    clips `dLoss/dz` to ±20, the right primitive for a one-layer convex
//!    model whose update is `lr · dz · x`. This head is four layers with a
//!    bilinear top, where the same `dz` produces wildly different
//!    weight-space steps depending on the activations. `--max-grad-norm`
//!    bounds the Euclidean norm of the whole accumulated gradient instead.
//!    The *objective* is byte-identical; only the optimiser is bounded
//!    differently.
//! 2. **The learning rate is selected on a TRAIN-internal holdout.** The
//!    additive model's `--lr 0.01` was not tuned against this architecture
//!    and there is no reason it should transfer. `--lr-grid` fits one model
//!    per candidate rate on TRAIN-minus-holdout and keeps the best holdout
//!    PR-AUC — registration §9: "Model selection happens on a TRAIN-internal
//!    holdout or it does not happen." DEV is not read until the run is over.
//!
//! # Zero-predictor floors are printed next to every metric
//!
//! The strict-positive rate is ~0.6%, so "PR-AUC 0.46" means nothing without
//! "a constant predictor scores 0.0059". Both numbers appear side by side in
//! every report this binary writes, for both arms.
//!
