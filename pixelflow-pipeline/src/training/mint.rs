/// The drift-corrected nanosecond value of a measurement, in the run's
/// *opening* clock.
///
/// # Order of operations
///
/// Normalize the **raw** reading, *then* subtract the call overhead:
///
/// ```text
/// label = ns * (calibration_ns / local_sentinel_ns) - call_overhead_ns
/// ```
///
/// The two operands live on different clocks and only one order puts them on
/// the same one. `call_overhead_ns` is the identity-kernel cost measured once
/// at session open, so it is denominated in the *opening* clock;
/// `BenchResult::ns` is denominated in the clock that was running when the
/// kernel was timed. The sentinel factor converts the second into the first,
/// which makes it a conversion on `ns` alone — `adjusted_ns` is a mixture of
/// the two clocks and scaling it converts neither correctly.
///
/// Scaling `adjusted_ns` instead (the original form) leaves a residue. With a
/// slowdown factor `d`, the raw reading is `d * (kernel + overhead)` and the
/// factor is `1/d`, so
///
/// ```text
/// (d * (kernel + overhead) - overhead) / d  =  kernel + overhead * (1 - 1/d)
/// ```
///
/// — a term that depends on `d`, i.e. on *when in the run* the expression was
/// benchmarked. That is precisely the order-dependent contamination the
/// sentinel exists to remove, and at the accepted sub-50% drift band with a
/// ~4ns call overhead it is >1ns, which is a large fraction of the smallest
/// kernels — the bulk of the corpus. This function no longer has an
/// opportunity to get that order wrong: it delegates to
/// [`BenchResult::corrected_session_ns`], where the raw reading is a
/// [`crate::jit_bench::LocalNs`] with no `Sub` impl, so overhead cannot be
/// taken off before normalization runs.
///
/// The alternative, remeasuring the identity kernel next to every label and
/// normalizing that too, is rejected: it buys the same number at the price of
/// a benchmark per label plus that benchmark's own noise, when the sentinel
/// factor already carries exactly the clock-speed information needed to move
/// the one operand that is on the wrong clock.

/// from a sessionless wrapper which runs no sentinel at all, so there is no
/// drift information to correct with and no drift protection behind the
