//! Checkpoint format and record→candidate encoding for the **bilinear**
//! saturation Guide (`docs/plans/2026-09-02-bilinear-guide-registration.md`).
//!
//! Shared by `train_guide_bilinear` (writes) and `skew_test_bilinear_guide`
//! (reads), for the same reason `guide_linear` is shared by the additive
//! trainer and its skew test: a skew test that used its own copy of "what a

//! Parsing lives here rather than in `pixelflow-search` (which owns
//! [`BilinearWeights`] as a parsed value and owns the *refusal*), exactly as
//! `guide_linear` does for the additive head: `pixelflow-pipeline` already
//! depends on `serde_json`, and adding it to `pixelflow-search` for a loader
//! only the training crate calls would widen that crate's dependency surface
//! for nobody's benefit.
