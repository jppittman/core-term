//! # Scene: what gets rendered into a frame
//!
//! A scene is a [`PackedFrame`] — four channel kernels compiled at the
//! frame's lattice shape, with the pixel pack inside the kernel, which is a
//! compiled manifold with four channels. Rendering it is **one collapse call
//! per stripe**, stripes across threads, the kernel's stores landing **in the
//! frame itself**. No per-batch FFI boundary, no virtual dispatch, no
//! per-pixel scalar pack, no staging plane and no row copy, and the collapse
//! kernel's two-level LICM prologues (per call, per row) active. Byte order
//! comes from the pixel format the frame is stored in
//! ([`compile_packed_for`], [`compile_platform_packed`]), never from
//! application code.
//!
//! The cell grid ([`compile_cell_grid_for`]) is one instance of that: a
//! geometry that denotes four channel kernels over a cell buffer and a
//! coverage atlas. A procedural shader is another: four kernels and nothing
//! bound. There is no second lane: S4a deleted the per-batch `Surface`
//! variant and the work-stealing rasterizer behind it.
