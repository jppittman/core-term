//! Message types for rasterizer actor communication.
//!
//! The rasterizer actor uses a **bootstrap pattern** for initialization:
//!
//! 1. Call `RasterizerActor::spawn_with_setup(num_threads)` to get a `SetupHandle`
//! 2. Send your response channel via `setup_handle.register(response_tx)`
//! 3. Receive the full `RasterizerHandle` back - now you can send render requests
//!
//! This pattern enforces at the **type level** that you cannot send render requests
//! without first registering where responses should go.
//!
//! ## Priority Lanes (after bootstrap)
//!
//! - **Data**: Frame rendering requests (backpressure when full)
//! - **Control**: Shutdown and high-priority commands
//! - **Management**: Configuration updates (thread count, etc.)
