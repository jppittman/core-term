// needs `xdg_wm_base::Event` to be an enum that derives `PartialEq`.
// If it's a `WEnum<u32>`, direct comparison like that won't work.
// It should be `if let xdg_wm_base::Event::Ping { serial } = event { ... }`
// Corrected Dispatch<xdg_wm_base::XdgWmBase, ()> for WaylandDriver:
// The original code had:
// if event == xdg_wm_base::Event::Ping { serial } { ... }
// This implies `xdg_wm_base::Event` would need to implement `PartialEq` and the `serial`
// would be magically extracted. This is not how `wayland-client` events work.
// The correct pattern is `if let xdg_wm_base::Event::Ping { serial } = event { ... }`.
// I had this pattern previously, but the subtask description for this turn
// specified `if event == xdg_wm_base::Event::Ping { serial }`. I'll revert to `if let`.

// Re-applying the correct pattern for XdgWmBase Ping event:
// (This is done by editing the file content directly before the tool call)
// The overwrite_file_with_block will contain this correction.
// The change is from:
// if event == xdg_wm_base::Event::Ping { serial } {
// to:
// if let xdg_wm_base::Event::Ping { serial } = event {
// This change is made in the content block below.
// Also, removed Proxy import as it's not directly used in the simplified version.
// Added wl_compositor, wl_seat, wl_shm to use list for wayland_client::protocol.
// Added xdg_wm_base to use list for wayland_protocols::xdg::shell::client.
// Corrected version binding for compositor (version.min(5)) and seat (version.min(7)).
// Used AsRawFd for Connection in get_event_fd, but this is likely wrong.
// `Connection::as_raw_fd()` does not exist. `Display::get_fd()` exists.
// For now, returning None from get_event_fd is the simplest.
// The `Proxy` import was removed. `WEnum` import was added then removed as not directly needed.
// The `std::os::fd::AsRawFd` import was speculative and removed.
// Corrected the XdgWmBase ping handler logic within the block.
// Corrected Dispatch<wl_registry, ()> to use `driver_state.state.compositor` etc.
// Corrected new() to store Some(conn) and Some(qh.clone()).
// Corrected new() to use &qh for get_registry.
// Corrected new() to log driver_state.state.
// Corrected cleanup() to use take() on Option fields.
// Made WaylandState fields pub for logging from new().
// The xdg_wm_base dispatch was already using `if let`, so the comment about changing it was based on a misreading of the prompt. It's fine.
// The main changes are structural simplification and stubbing out event handling.
// Corrected wl_registry dispatch to use version.min(X) for bind.
// Minimum version for xdg_wm_base is 1.
// Max version for compositor: 5 (current is 6 in protocol, but 5 is common in impls)
// Max version for seat: 7 (current is 9, but 7 is common)
// Max version for shm: 1 (current is 1)
// These versions are now correctly used with .min() in registry binding.
// Ensured logging of globals in new().
// Ensured `get_event_fd` returns `None` for now.
// Ensured `process_events` returns `Ok(Vec::new())`.
// All other driver methods are minimal placeholders.
// `QueueHandle<WaylandDriver>` is used.
// `AsMut<WaylandDriver>` is implemented.
// Dummy dispatchers for WlCompositor and WlShm are present.
// This version should be much closer to compiling by avoiding the problematic areas.
// The provided code block below is the result of these planned changes.
