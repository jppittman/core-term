//! Zero-sized type marker trait.
//!
//! This module provides a marker trait [`Zst`] for identifying types that have
//! no runtime representation (zero-sized types). This is useful for:
//!
//! - Static assertion that a type compiles to no data
//! - Enabling optimizations based on ZST knowledge
//! - Documenting which types are purely compile-time constructs
//!
//! # What is a ZST?
//!
//! A zero-sized type (ZST) is a type that occupies zero bytes of memory.
//! In Rust, these types exist only at compile time and have no runtime cost.
//!
//! Examples in PixelFlow:
//! - Coordinate variables (`X`, `Y`, `Z`, `W`) - no data, just identity
//! - Spherical harmonic basis functions - only const generic parameters
//! - Operators where all operands are ZSTs - no data to store
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pixelflow_core::{Zst, X, Y};
//! use pixelflow_core::ops::Add;
//!
//! fn assert_zst<T: Zst>() {}
//!
//! assert_zst::<X>();           // ✓ X is a ZST
//! assert_zst::<Y>();           // ✓ Y is a ZST
//! assert_zst::<Add<X, Y>>();   // ✓ Add<X, Y> is a ZST (both operands are ZSTs)
//! ```
